### Theme Features

Oslo Lite is an elegant and simplified version of our Oslo WordPress theme for Ghost. A two-column display showcases photography and text as perfect companions, while a sidebar navigation overlay keeps your blog crisp and organized at all times.

### Sidebar Custom Links

Olso Lite features a beautifully styled sidebar to house your blog&#39;s title, cover image, description, and customizable navigation.

Custom links are easily added to the Oslo Lite sidebar. To add a custom link, open `/partials/sidebar.hbs`. The file contains detailed instructions and an example link to get you started.

### Sharing Widget

Oslo Lite features a bespoke sharing widget allowing your content to be easily shared across Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus with the click of a button.

### Disqus Commenting

Oslo Lite supports Disqus commenting on post and static page templates. To enable Disqus, locate the disabled code at the bottom of &quot;post.hbs&rdquo; or &ldquo;page.hbs&rdquo; and remove the html comments (`<!--` and `—>`). Replace &quot;DISQUS SHORTNAME&quot; with your personal Disqus shortname.

### Social Media Links

Social media links can be added to the Oslo Lite sidebar by editing your theme file. First, uncompress your theme file – which is in .zip format – by double-clicking the file.

Then, once the Oslo Lite folder is open, go into the **Partials** folder and open up the **social-links.hbs** file in a text editor. (TextEdit for Mac or Notepad for Windows will do.)


You will find a list of 28 social links that are currently disabled. To enable them, simply copy and paste the relevant links into the space below `END DISABLED CODE -->`.

Finally, include your desired URL in place of the 4 consecutive hashtags (`####`) in the social links you just copied. Save the file and then compress the main Oslo Lite folder into .zip format (left-click and select "compress"). Reupload your edited theme file to Ghost and your social links will now show up in your sidebar.

### Supported Social Platforms

YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter, Svpply, Stumbleupon, Spotify, Soundcloud, Skype, Rdio, Pinterest, Pinboard, Myspace, Mail, LinkedIn, LastFM, Instagram, Google Plus, GitHub, Foursquare, Flickr, Facebook, Etsy, Dribbble, Digg, DeviantART, Delicious, Behance, and Bandcamp.
